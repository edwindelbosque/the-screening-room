# The Screening Room: A Movie Tracker web app

## Summary

Ever been curious about what movies are currently out in theaters and wish you could get more info about them? Welcome to Movie Tracker where you can sign in, see the latest movies, and favorite them for later.

As a result of building out this project, we developed some muscle memory building out applications with Redux. We also got a much more practice doing network requests with a backend and fetching a nested API from 'TheMovieDB'.

## Check out our live app in Heroku [here](https://the-screening-room.herokuapp.com/)!
